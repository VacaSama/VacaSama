- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VacaSama
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... all things art! Expressing creativity is my passion, amongst others like anime, gaming, (foreign) language learning and programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... computer programming and working towards my degree in it. Front-end programming is super cool to me, but I refuse to limit myself.
          In my free time I also like to learn (foreign) languages. Spanish and French are my main focus when I do have time to learn, but in the future I hope to learn ASL. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... for now, you can reach me through GitHub until I have other Social Media platforms made :)
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... "Vaca" means 'Cow' in Spanish.
