- 👋 Hi, I’m Kourtnie aka VacaSama!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... all things art! Expressing creativity is a great passion and hobby of mine, amongst others like anime, gaming, (foreign) language learning and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... computer programming and working towards my degree in it. Front-end programming is super cool to me, and I'm familiar with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, but I refuse to limit myself, other languages I'll dive into are Java, C#, .Net Development and a few others within my degree. 
          In my free time I also like to learn (foreign) languages. Spanish and French are my main focus when I do have time to learn, but in the future I hope to learn ASL.
- 📫 How to reach me ... for now, you can reach me through GitHub until I have other Social Media platforms made :)
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... "Vaca" means 'Cow' in Spanish.

I have a few personal projects in the works however they have not been posted here quite yet, because they are on a it of a larger scale. The personal project I hope to turn into a "masterwork", would be an RPG Website Design for a fictional/fantasy game called "Lost Order of Papiyas". 
As I learn throughout my degree plan I will post my projects in designated files so that I can not only track my progress but to show future prospects and/or employers 👍
